## Installation

`stellar` can be installed directly from GitHub via any of the following methods

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_packages("ropenscilabs/stellar")
```

or

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_packages("ropenscilabs/stellar")
```

## How?

The only thing you need is a Personal Access Token from github. If you don't
know how:
1. Go to your personal settings (under your profile pic, top right)
2. On the left, under the main "Personal Settings" box, click "Developer
   Settings" -> "Personal Access Tokens" and generate a new one. You'll need to
   check the box for accessing repository data via the github API v4.
3. Save this as an **R** environmental variable called `GITHUB_GRAPHQL_TOKEN`
   with `Sys.setenv("GITHUB_GRAPHQL_TOKEN" = <your token>)`. This can either be
   done within a single session, or automatically for all sessions by pasting
   this command within your `~/.Rprofile` file. (Simply create this file if it
   doesn't already exist.)
